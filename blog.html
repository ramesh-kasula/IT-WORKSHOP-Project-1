    <h2><u>History</u>:</h2>
    <p>Animation in Japan began in the <em>early 20th century</em>, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is <em>Katsudō Shashin</em> (c. 1907), a private work by an unknown creator. In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as <em>Ōten Shimokawa</em>, <em>Seitarō Kitayama</em>, and <em>Jun'ichi Kōuchi</em> (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana. Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.<br>

        By the mid-1930s animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers, <br>such as Disney, and many animators, including <em>Noburō Ōfuji</em> and <em>Yasuji Murata</em>, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation. Other creators, including <em>Kenzō Masaoka</em> and <em>Mitsuyo Seo</em>, nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government,<br> which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda. In 1940, the government dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai. The first talkie anime was <em>Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka</em> (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka. The first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br>
        <br>
        The 1970s saw growth in the popularity of manga, many of which were later animated. <em>Tezuka's</em> work—and that of other pioneers in the field—inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant robot genre (also known as "<em>mecha</em>"), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the super robot genre under Go Nagai and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by <em>Yoshiyuki Tomino</em>, who developed the real robot genre. Robot anime series such as Gundam and Super Dimension Fortress Macross became instant classics in the 1980s, and the genre remained<br> one of the most popular in the following decades. The bubble economy of the 1980s spurred a new era of high-budget and experimental anime films, including <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984)</em>, <em>Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (1987)</em>, and <em>Akira (1988)</em>.<br>
        <br>
        <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995)</em>, a television series produced by <em>Gainax</em> and directed by <em>Hideaki Anno</em>, began another era of experimental anime titles, such as <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> (1995) and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> (1998). In the 1990s, anime also began attracting greater interest in Western countries; major international successes include <em>Sailor Moon</em> and <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide. In 2003, Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli feature film directed by <em>Hayao Miyazaki</em>, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards. It later became the highest-grossing anime film, earning more than $355 million. Since the 2000s, an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels; successful examples include The Melancholy of <em>Haruhi Suzumiya</em> and <em>Fate/stay night</em> (both 2006).

<h2><u>Attributes</u>:</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Modernanime.jpg" style="float: right;">
<p>Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its <em>diverse art styles</em>, <em>methods of animation</em>, its <em>production</em>, and its <em>process</em>. Visually, anime works exhibit a<br> wide variety of art styles, differing between creators, artists, and studios. While no one art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes<br> in terms of animation technique and character design.

</p>
<h2><u>Technique</u>:</h2>
<p>Modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. Early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by <em>Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto</em> and <em>Tomoyasu Murata</em>. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.<br>
    <br>
    Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike Disney animation, where<br> the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices. Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work. The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in<br> Howl's Moving Castle and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast<br> usually comes out looking "tremendously impressive".
     <br>
     The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality. In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause lip sync errors in the Japanese version.
</p>
<h2><u>Characters</u>:</h2>
<p>Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall. Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like Crayon Shin-chan completely disregard these proportions, in such a way that they resemble caricatured Western cartoons.<br>
   <br>

    A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as Betty Boop, who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes. The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used. Cultural anthropologist Matt Thorn argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign. However, not all anime characters have large eyes. For example, the works of Hayao Miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.<br>
    <br>
    Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts. These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods. For example, a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused. A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweat drops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.

<h2><u>Genres</u>:</h2>
<p>Anime's genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification. <em>Gilles Poitras</em> compared the labeling <em>Gundam 0080</em> and its complex depiction of war as a "<em>giant robot</em>" anime akin to simply labeling War and Peace a "<em>war novel</em>". Science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like Tezuka's <em>Astro Boy</em> and Yokoyama's <em>Tetsujin 28-go</em>. A major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the Gundam metaseries being iconic. The diverse fantasy genre includes works based on Asian and Western traditions and folklore; examples include the Japanese feudal fairytale InuYasha, and the depiction of Scandinavian goddesses who move to Japan to maintain a computer called Yggdrasil in Ah! My Goddess. Genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in Dragon Half, and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film Castle of Cagliostro. Other subgenres found in anime include magical girl, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism and war.
</p>
<h2><u>Music</u>:</h2>
<p>The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes are accompanied by Japanese pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.</p>
<h2><u>Awards</u>:</h2>

<p>The anime industry has several annual awards that honor the year's best works. Major annual awards in Japan include the <em>Ōfuji Noburō</em> Award, the <em>Mainichi Film</em> Award for Best Animation Film, the <em>Animation Kobe</em> Awards, the <em>Japan Media Arts Festival animation</em> awards, the <em>Tokyo Anime Award</em> and the <em>Japan Academy Prize</em> for Animation of the Year. In the United States, anime films compete in the <em>Crunchyroll Anime Awards</em>. There were also the American Anime Awards, which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006. Anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature or the Golden Bear.</p>
<h2><u>Anime Style</u>:</h2>
<p>One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of Western cartoons is the <em>potential</em> for visceral content. Once the expectation that the aspects of <em>visual intrigue</em> or animation being just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes involving violence, suffering, sexuality, pain, and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other types of media. However, as anime itself became increasingly popular, its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. South Park's "<em>Chinpokomon</em>" and "<em>Good Times with Weapons</em>" episodes, Adult Swim's Perfect Hair Forever, and Nickelodeon's Kappa Mikey are Western examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime, but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime, such as <em>KonoSuba</em>.</p>
<h2><u>Fan Response</u>:</h2>
<p>Anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the 1990s with the "<em>anime boom</em>", a period marked by increased popularity of anime. These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like <em>cosplay</em> contests and industry talk panels. Cosplay, a portmanteau for "costume play", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions. Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including otaku, an unflattering Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga. Another word that has arisen describing fans in the United States is wapanese meaning 'white individuals who want to be Japanese', or later known as weeaboo, individuals who demonstrate a strong interest in Japanese anime subculture, a term that originated from abusive content posted on the popular bulletin board website 4chan.org. Anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art, including computer wallpapers and anime music videos.
 As of the 2010s, many anime fans use online communities and databases such as MyAnimeList to discuss anime and track their progress watching respective series.
