<h2 align="center"><u>TYPES</u></h2>
<h2><u>Types Of Anime</u>:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Shonen</strong>:<em>Shonen</em> can be translated to mean few years in English, and refers to a younger male audience. Shonen anime usually look to meet all the interests of younger males. Most of the series feature a young male protagonist. Shonen anime have some of the most popular and well known franchise as they contain a little bit of everything. There's elements of action, adventure, fighting, drama, comedy, and coming of age.
    </li>
   <li><strong>Seinen</strong>:<em>Seinen</em> can be translated as young man in English, and targets the young adult or adult male viewers. Seinen anime usually have the same stories and themes as shonen, however are more sophisticated than shonen.They are more 
       violent, sexual, satirical, or psychologically intense and therefore cater to a more mature audience. </li>
   <li><strong>Shoujo</strong>:<em>Shoujo</em> is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also
        still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen</li>
   <li><strong>Josei</strong>:As shoujo is the counterpart of shonen, <em>josei</em> is the opposite of seinen. Seinen shows are targeted towards adult female viewers and focus more on romance than anything. They usually have a more realistic feel than shoujo and
        feature adult woman. </li>
   <li><strong>Kodomomuke</strong>:Last but not least we have another genre that most have at least seen one show from <em>kodomomuke</em>. Kodomomuke means directed at children in English, and is the only genre suitable for young viewers. They usually are super cute,
        imaginative, and creative, as well as has a moral message. </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Shōnen manga is typically characterized by high-action, often humorous plots featuring male protagonists. Commonly-found themes in shōnen manga include martial arts, robots, science fiction, sports, horror or mythological creatures. The camaraderie between boys or men on sports teams, fighting squads, and the like are often emphasized. Protagonists of such manga often feature an ongoing desire to better themselves, and often face challenges to their abilities, skills and maturity, where self-perfection, austere self-discipline, sacrifice in the cause of duty and honorable service to society, community, family and friends are stressed.

None of these listed characteristics are a requirement, as seen in shōnen manga like Yotsuba&!, which features a female lead and almost no fan service or action; what defines whether or not a series is shōnen is the official classification of the magazine it is serialized in.<br>

The art style of shōnen is generally less "flowery" than that of shōjo manga, although this varies greatly from artist to artist, and some artists draw both shōnen and shōjo manga.

<h3>Seinen:</h3>
<img src="https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shounen-anime-image.jpg" width=400 style="float: right;">
<p>
    In Japanese, the word seinen literally means "youth", but the term "seinen manga" is also used to describe the target audience of comics like Weekly Manga Times and Weekly Manga Goraku which catered specifically to men's interests, and is marketed towards older teenage boys and adult men demographics. Seinen manga are distinguished from shōnen manga which are for younger teen boys, although some seinen manga like xxxHolic share similarities with shōnen manga. Seinen manga can focus on action, politics, science fiction, fantasy, relationships, sports, or comedy. The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga.

Seinen manga have a wide variety of art styles and variation in subject matter. Examples of seinen series include: Berserk, Excel Saga, Ghost in the Shell, Hellsing, Initial D, Monster, Mushishi, Oh My Goddess!, One-Punch Man, Outlaw Star, Tokyo Ghoul, the formerly shōnen manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and Trigun.<br>
<br>
A common way to tell if a manga is seinen is by looking at whether furigana is used over the original kanji text: if there are furigana on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine it was published in is also an important indicator. Usually Japanese manga magazines with the word "young" in the title (Weekly Young Jump for instance) are seinen. There are also mixed shōnen/seinen magazines such as Gangan Powered and Comp Ace. Other popular seinen manga magazines include Weekly Young Magazine, Weekly Young Sunday, Big Comic Spirits, Business Jump, Ultra Jump, and Afternoon.

<h3>Shoujo:</h3>

<p>
    Shōjo, shojo, or shoujo manga (少女漫画) is manga aimed at a young teen female target-demographic readership. The name romanizes the Japanese 少女 (shōjo), literally "young woman" in English. Shōjo manga covers many subjects in a variety of narrative styles, from historical drama to science fiction, often with a focus on romantic relationships or emotions.

Strictly speaking, however, shōjo manga does not comprise a style or genre, but rather indicates a target demographic.<br>
<br>
As shōjo literally means "girl" in Japanese, the equivalent of the Western usage will generally include the term: girls' manga (少女漫画, shōjo manga), or anime for girls (少女向けアニメ shōjo-muke anime). The parallel terms shōnen, seinen, and josei also occur in the categorization of manga and anime, with similar qualification.

<h3>Josei:</h3>
<img src="https://geeksoncoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Karneval.jpeg" width=400 style="float: right;">
<p>
    Josei manga (女性漫画, lit. "women's comics", pronounced [dʑoseː]) are Japanese comics catered specifically to women's interests, and is marketed towards older teenage girls and adult women demographics who are able to read kanji without the aid of furigana. Subgenres of josei manga include "ladies' comics" (レディースコミックス, redīsu komikkusu) (also known as "LadyComi" (レディコミ, redikomi)) and teens' love. Readers can range in age from 18 to 45.

Unlike shōjo manga, which is aimed at young girls, Josei manga often portray realistic romance, as opposed to the mostly idealized romance of shōjo manga. They tend to be both more sexually explicit and contain more mature storytelling than shōjo manga, although this is not always the case either.<br>
<br>
Some of the most popular josei manga have featured male protagonists and/or an almost entirely male main cast, and the male characters are often quite compassionate toward other men. Although some josei manga can contain plots and characters influenced by shōjo manga, others tell action-packed stories and lack the romantic and slice of life elements associated with shōjo.

<h3>Kodomomuke:</h3>
<p>
    Children's manga (子供向け漫画, kodomo-muke manga) and children's anime (子供向けアニメ, kodomo-muke anime) refer to manga and anime directed towards children 10 years and under. These series are usually moralistic, often educating children about staying in the right path in life. Each chapter is usually a self-contained story. Notable examples include Doraemon and Hello Kitty.
    Kodomo manga started in the late 19th century with the production of short manga, approximately 15 pages long, printed in magazines. These short manga were created as a part of the Meiji era's attempt to encourage literacy among Japanese youth. A major milestone in the popularity of anime was the creation of Astro Boy by Osamu Tezuka, who is often considered the father of anime.<br>
